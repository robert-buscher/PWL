## Team
### **Robert Buscher**: Main.java, FrequencyRanking.java, RichVocab.java, README.md
### **Nicholas Tauro**: RemoveStopWords.java, BasicStats.java, AttitudeScorer.java, RepeatWords.java, UML diagram

## Classes and Methods
- **Main**: runs the program for one topic folder, calling the other classes.
- **RemoveStopWords**: loads a list of stop words, filters article text, and saves cleaned files. Uses createStopWordsList, filterArticle, and saveCleanedArticle methods.
