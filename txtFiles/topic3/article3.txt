You were managing just fine in an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom on the Upper East Side. Then a baby was added to the mix, and you realized you needed to get out of the city yesterday. Enter Fairfield County, Connecticut: the most populous county in the state, made up of over 35 cities and towns and boasting the unsexy yet practical combination of more space and a relatively easy commute to the city.

Now you’re winning the lifestyle game, but there’s a gaping hole in your heart that New York City restaurants used to fill. So we’ve compiled a list of the 25 best places to eat in Fairfield County that’ll make you even happier that you took the plunge into the burbs, rather than sending you fleeing to the Metro-North every time you want a great meal. 

Editor’s note: There are so many outstanding pizza places in Connecticut that we purposely excluded them from this guide in order to narrow down the list. Check back soon for a guide to our favorite pizza spots in the state. Though if you’re looking for the best pizza in New Haven, we ranked those here.

You could just get a pasta dish or a pizza from Bar Rosina’s in Greenwich, but you’d be doing it wrong. The path to success at this Italian restaurant is to order as many of their appetizers as you can fit on your table. Most of them are covered in a thick blanket of pecorino romano—you’ll get a strong whiff of cheese every time a waiter walks by. Make sure to prioritize some of the less conventionally Italian small plates, like the fried long hot peppers drizzled with labneh, and the burrata toast topped with strawberries, hazelnuts, and a savory brown butter sauce. If the weather’s nice, ask to sit outside on their cute patio with string lights. The spacious indoor dining room is also great for a big group dinner, especially one with any of your Westchester friends—it’s located one block from the New York border.

There are few places in the world where you can eat peking duck while listening to club music and uncorking a $6,500 bottle of Domaine Romanée-Conti. Moli in Greenwich is one of them. You’ll be greeted by no fewer than five crystal chandeliers towering over hedge fund managers and their done-up dates, but it’s worth coming here for more than the scene. The peking duck is outstanding, with juicy, flavorful meat, well-rendered fat, and shatteringly crisp skin. Go with a group and get the whole duck, which arrives in a flourish as it’s lit on fire tableside, then carved and portioned out into translucent pancakes with the works (hoisin sauce, cucumbers, and scallions). The rest of the menu can be a little hit-or-miss, but you’ll be happy if there are some plates of dumplings, zesty edamame hummus, tender baby back ribs, and lots of cocktails on the table.

Jewish
Greenwich
Perfect For:
Lunch
When you walk into a restaurant and it’s filled with old men eating soup, your meal is either going uphill or downhill, stat. At Greenwich & Delancey, it’s the former. The star of the menu at this upscale kosher deli is undoubtedly the pastrami sandwich, which at $36 is almost $10 more than Katz’s, but you’re in Greenwich, after all, and it’s worth it. The juicy pastrami is piled high onto homemade rye and served simply with spicy brown mustard and excellent all-you-can-eat pickles on the side. If you’re with a group and feeling flush, shell out $80 for the tableside service, where a whole side of pastrami is wheeled out on a cart, unveiled in a fragrant puff of smoke, and sliced like a prime rib for a make-your-own-sandwich adventure. Go on a weekday or Sunday, since the restaurant is closed for Shabbat.

Old Greenwich
Perfect For:
BYOB
Serious Takeout Operation
Keeping It Kind Of Healthy
Sushi Bar is a Japanese spot serving up Edomae-style sushi in the heart of quaint Old Greenwich. While the takeout is some of the best around, we recommend going in person, keeping in mind that it’s BYOB—there’s a wine shop a few doors down with an ample sake selection if you forgot yours at home. The chef makes every component of his sushi from scratch, including ground-to-order fresh wasabi and a sweet house-marinated ikura with taut and glossy (but never slimy) eggs. First timers will enjoy the omakase for its breadth of techniques and bar-raising nigiri toppings, like crispy onions, foie gras, and caviar. Supplement the omakase with at least one cut roll, like the salmon tsukemono with fatty chopped fish juxtaposing a rainbow assortment of pickles. Skip the dumplings, as they’re one of the only things not made in house, and instead save some space for crackly matcha creme brulee for dessert.

With its Medieval-esque stone walls, flickering candelabras dangling from double-height ceilings, accordion soundtrack, and display case of antique Balkan weapons, Çka ka Qëllu in Stamford has the unique vibe of “last good supper before going off to war.” Fortunately, it’s only good times ahead when dining here, particularly if you go with a big group. No table at this Albanian restaurant is complete without the creamy sausage dip, fasul (a savory white bean and sausage stew), mantia (browned, pillowy veal dumplings in yogurt sauce), and the mixed grill, which includes variously shaped ground meats that push the boundaries of acceptable levels of salt, in a good way. Stave off the end-of-meal meat sweats by ordering the creamy trilece cake and pair it with a delicious cereal milk cocktail, which tastes exactly how it sounds.

Stamford
Perfect For:
Big Groups
Classic Establishment
This wouldn’t be a proper Connecticut restaurant guide without a quintessential red sauce Italian spot in the ranks. Cafe Silvium in Stamford has been serving up big portions of homemade pasta and even bigger wine pours for over 20 years, and the quality (and quantity) is still outstanding. It works for any occasion—a large family dinner, date, or a night out with friends, with warm service that’s likely to include a personal greeting from the owners upon walking in. Sit down and immediately order the milky homemade mozzarella while you complete the nearly impossible task of choosing a few dishes from the huge menu. The massive and crispy veal milanese should be on your table, as should the black linguine with scallops and marinara sauce, plus a few pastas that capture your heart. Skip the forgettable complimentary bread, and save room for the dense ricotta pistachio cake for dessert instead.

If you can get past the high likelihood of overhearing someone at a neighboring table unironically call an acquaintance a "Harvard Man," this cozy French bistro in Darien is worth going out of your way for. Pretty much everything from the seasonal French menu is made in house, from the bread to the ice cream. The dishes change quarterly, but the pillowy, light-as-air gnocchi are always around, and they should definitely be on your table. Other hits include the sea bass in beurre blanc, the crunchy, bright green salad bursting with fresh herbs, and the warmly spiced duck leg confit. And don’t skip dessert—the custardy chocolate chip bread pudding topped with homemade ice cream is one of our favorite sweets in the whole state.

New Canaan

Special Occasions
Downtown New Canaan, with its walkable tree-lined streets, has that quintessential small-town Connecticut feel, and sitting right in the middle of it is Elm. This American restaurant is how Fairfield County does a neighborhood spot—families with small children sit alongside couples on date night, in a perpetually packed, low-lit, minimalist dining room. They have a big menu of small plates, salads, pasta, and seafood, but you’re here for their massive burger—it’s got two thick patties, half sour pickles, a sesame and poppyseed bun, and melty cheese. It can get messy, and you might need to unhinge your jaw to eat it, but once you pick it up, you’ll neglect everyone else at your table until you’ve finished every last bit.

A far cry from the city-like atmosphere of South Norwalk, Tavern at GrayBarns is located a few miles north within a fancy riverside hotel in a quiet, woodsy corner of town. If a $900-per-night staycation at the inn isn’t in the cards, book a table at the Tavern and request a bar or patio seat with the view of the charming gardens and the pond on the property—it’s the perfect setting for a romantic date or quiet catchup with friends. We always order the crispy fried oyster mushrooms with buttermilk dipping sauce, which are basically a grown-up version of chicken nuggets, and the perfectly cooked dry aged ribeye. Pair them with one of the well-curated wines by the glass and enjoy your mini vacation.

Lunch
There’s no place more quintessentially Connecticut than Rowayton Seafood, where you can enjoy a $36 lobster roll while watching Polo-clad locals descend from their boats onto the docks out front. You’re paying for the waterfront location as well as high-quality chunks of lobster, prepared either Connecticut-style or Maine-style. Skip the fries—they’re pale and under-seasoned—and instead, opt for the crispy onion rings or homemade potato chips on the side. Other welcome additions to your meal would be anything from the raw bar or the parmesan roasted oysters, which might beat lobster mac and cheese in the unlikely competition of “best rendition of hot shellfish with cheese”. Be sure to make a lunch reservation in advance if you want a table with a view, since this place gets packed, even on weekdays.

Washington Street in South Norwalk has seen a lot of restaurant openings (and closings) over the past decade, but Match is the neighborhood favorite that’s always stuck around. It’s probably due to their crowd-pleasing seasonal menu of shareable small plates that’ll actually fill you up, including pizzettes cooked in a wood-fired oven and a raw bar selection with oysters freshly harvested from the Long Island Sound that surrounds South Norwalk. Their cocktail menu might be even better than their food—the purple spicy margarita is the best (and the strongest) one we’ve had in Fairfield County. Just keep that in mind before you order another round.

Perfect For:

Coffee & A Light Bite
Norwalk Art Space Cafe is as local as it gets—it’s a seemingly simple space located inside a museum that features art by artists from the community, many of their ingredients are sourced from nearby bakeries and restaurants, and proceeds help fund their free art classes. Literally anything in their baked goods display case is worth getting, but you should always order the cheddar and chive biscuit with black pepper. Ask them to warm it up and place some butter on top, and then go ahead and order a second one. They also serve lunch here, but this space is best for a decadent brunch while catching up with friends over a freshly prepared french toast bake that’s swimming in a pool of buttery blueberry sauce and sprinkled with lavender sugar.

Perfect For:

Lunch
Kneads in Westport is a bakery and cafe that takes itself very seriously. Founded by two former Blue Hill at Stone Barns sous chefs, all the flour used in their homemade breads and pastries is milled onsite from local grains. We find their plain croissants a little too whole-wheat-y, but love the sweeter options like the apple turnover and sticky pecan croissant, where the nutty flour balances the fillings. Their sandwiches are made on their excellent homemade sourdough bread—standouts include the ham and cheese dripping with melted rosemary butter, or the turkey melt with gruyere, apples, and bacon. The coffee is also always on point, so no matter what craving you’re trying to satisfy, you’ll find something at Kneads that hits just right.

This cozy, upscale waterfront Westport seafood bar always fulfills its promise of the freshest local oysters (don’t miss the roasted ones with kimchi butter) and a consistently delicious rotating crudo. But what keeps us coming back is the juicy bacon cheeseburger, which is hands down the best in the area, as well as a fantastic fried chicken sandwich, both accompanied by their crispy, savory fries. Head here for Happy Hour and watch boats cruise down the Saugatuck river from the front patio while sipping on a Frogger cocktail and catching up with a big table of family or friends.

If you ask three Westport locals about their favorite dish at Kawa Ni, you’ll get four answers. That’s because across its large menu, this modern izakaya delivers consistently excellent Japanese bar food with a twist. We’re partial to the sweet and smoky shaved broccoli salad, make-your-own salmon handrolls with everything seasoning, and the kimchi carbonara, but we’ve never had a miss here. This also happens to be a great place to start a night out on the town, with the $10 house sake, an on-tap highball, or a flavored sake bomb delivered with the ring of a cowbell to get the party started. It’s nearly impossible to get a reservation, but we can almost always snag walk-in seats for an early dinner at the bar, which is our favorite place to sit anyway.

If the name OKO rings a bell, it’s because this Japanese restaurant’s Rye counterpart also appears in our guide to the best restaurants in Westchester. Both the sushi bar and kitchen dishes in this converted firehouse space are equally great—start your meal with the pleasingly crunchy tempura-fried shiso leaves with creamy tofu dip, or the pear and cabbage salad with nutty miso dressing. On the sushi front, the $50 chef’s selection of 10 classic-with-a-twist nigiri is a great value, since most pieces on their own will run you $10-$20 each. Alternatively, you can’t go wrong with tempura mushroom bao, the duck and foie gras gyoza, or the truffled wagyu crispy rice nigiri. Close out your meal with the homemade soft serve or matcha Kit Kat, which are anything but an afterthought.

It’s rare to find a restaurant in Fairfield County that delivers on the essential trifecta of food, service, and atmosphere, but Casa Me in Westport does just that. This buzzy spot transports its diners straight to an Italian vacation with playful cocktails, sexy interiors, and a menu created by a chef who knows how to cook his way from Milan down to Sicily. The homemade pastas are great (you’ll need at least two on your table), the well-seasoned chicken milanese has no hint of sogginess, and the towering green salad will make you feel like you’re celebrity-spotting at Via Carota. If you don’t snag a reservation in advance, they can almost always squeeze you in at the central communal tables, which are the best vantage point to observe the local moms on their nights out, Negronis in one hand and Chanel bags in the other.

Don’t be deterred by the doggy daycare and multi-story parking lot flanking Esh’s nondescript entrance. You’ll experience a Lion, Witch and Wardrobe-level transfiguration as you step into this Fairfield Middle Eastern restaurant’s cavernous, moody space. A roaring wood-burning oven in the middle of the open kitchen churns out steaming, pillowy flatbreads that pair perfectly with whichever dips speak to your soul—they’re all solid, especially the spicy feta. Feel free to over-order the appetizers here, our favorite section of the menu other than the dips. We’re obsessed with the Moroccan cigars, which are filled with meltingly tender, warmly spiced beef and encrusted in layers of crackling phyllo dough. For something more substantial, the crispy-skinned branzino with herby green sauce is our go-to entree.

Classic Establishment
This Fairfield institution might have a very silly name, but they make some very serious hot dogs. Open since 2000 in a tiny diner-style space, Super Duper Weenie serves seven dog styles that are inspired by cities all over the country, which means the New Yorker and the Chicago dog actually sit in harmony next to each other on the menu. Everything here tastes ridiculously fresh thanks to the housemade toppings and sauces (don’t skip the hot relish), house-baked buns, and the weenies themselves that are cooked to order and split down the middle. In addition to the extra-loaded hot dogs, you can get chicken nuggets, sandwiches, and burgers—including a super solid veggie burger on a portuguese roll served with a spicy sauce we want to bottle and take home. No matter which route you go, ordering a side of freshly cooked fries and a super-thick milkshake to dunk them in is basically a requirement.

Soul Food
Bridgeport
Perfect For:

There are a number of reasons why this American restaurant with inventive takes on soul food in Bridgeport might have won one of the biggest awards a new restaurant can get in Connecticut. It could be that it brought pro cooking techniques and a high-end dining experience to an area that historically hasn’t had much else along those lines, or the friendly service, or even the contemporary art-filled walls. But we’d argue that the real reason is the spiced and smoked half chicken, one of the only staple items on the restaurant’s menu and among the best things we’ve ever eaten—it’s sweet, smoky, and as juicy as a summer peach. The fried chicken sandwich is also insanely good, as are the seasonally rotating vegetable appetizers. Be prepared for a personal visit from the chef at the end of the meal, as he makes a habit of going around to shake every diner’s hand before closing up for the night.

Go to Athithi for lunch on a light “work from home day” and prepare to be blown away. Start off with the tangy-glazed lasooni gobi, which is kind of like buffalo cauliflower’s Indian cousin, and the samosa tasting—we bet you’ll be fighting your dining partners over the last of the gooey jalapeño cheese ones. $14 will get you a generously portioned lunch special to satisfy a craving for old faithfuls like saag paneer or butter chicken, which are some of the best versions we’ve had of these dishes to date. Most dishes on the menu travel well, so this is also a great takeout spot when you’re in the mood for a cozy night in.

Come to Luc’s on a spring or summer evening and sit on their patio, and you’ll be transported to Paris, even though you’re eating right next to a parking lot of Suburbans and Porsches. Just face away from the vehicles and soak in the flower beds, the twinkling string lights, and the live guitar player while sipping on a Gabrielle spritz (their signature cocktail with St. Germain and crémant). And if the patio is full, the quaint, cozy basement dining room with stone walls and daily specials handwritten on a chalkboard feels equally Parisian. You can very easily fill up on the free table bread and butter, but make sure to save room for a cheese board appetizer and an entree—the chicken is simple but seasoned perfectly, and the sole filet is served in a butter-heavy sauce you’ll be wiping off your chin all night long.

It’s extremely easy to drive right past Hanna’s in Danbury—the tiny restaurant and market is squeezed between a pawn shop and a laundromat. But skipping over Hanna’s would be a mistake, because you’ll miss out on the freshest, most filling Middle Eastern dishes in the county. The menu is mostly mezze, so order a combo platter to get a sampling of some of their best—we really like the hummus, tabbouli, stuffed grape leaves, and falafel platter. You’ll also find a lot of hearty salads and entrees so big, you’ll be asking for multiple takeout boxes (we often take home at least five). Stop by here for a satisfying lunch—a large meal for two should only cost around $50.
